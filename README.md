# Supervisely2COCO
Original script author: Caio Marcellos. Modified the script to also add segmentation points from the exterior section of supervisely annotation files.

Edit: I've finally needed the coco format to work to inspect Mask R-CNN model so I decided to convert the original into a jupyter script. "ann" and "images" directories need to be added holding the proper files.
